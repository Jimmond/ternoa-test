### Hi there, God bless u ðŸ‘‹




To test this work of art, I suggest you to enter directly to my app in heroku, however you can see the code and test it in your computer locally _**(the payment will not be done in a local environment, it only works in production)**_, follow the steps:

~~~
npm i
npm start
~~~
You need environment variables to run the app (.env), you could send me an email to jlortiz9903@gmail.com and I would send the call to use, however with the app in Heroku([App](https://nfts-store.herokuapp.com/)) I understand that it shows what is needed.
